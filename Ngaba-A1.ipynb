    "So far, you've learned very important fundamental concepts in Machine Learning such as supervised learning (e.g. classification and regression) vs unsupervised learning (e.g. clustering), overfitting, model evaluation, and performance measures (accuracy, precision, recall, AUC, MSE, etc.). You've learned that two of the most common approaches in supervised learning are regression and classification. In this assignment, you are going to practice what you've learned so far by building ML models and applying them on data.\n",

    "<b>Very Important Note:</b> Read ALL the instructions in this notebook very carefully. **Wherever the documentation link is provided, click on the links and read the documentation!** Careless reading and skipping instructions are major sources of making mistakes and losing points in your assignments. Also note that this assignment has three parts and includes multiple steps and questions. You're strongly recommended to get started early and plan to finish well before the due date. Technical problems or other issues/questions on the due date or just a day before would NOT be accepted as an excuse for extension."

    "<b>Course Policy Reminder</b>\n",
    "Debugging the codes and error resolution are ALWAYS the students' responsbility regardless of the source or the cause of the error. This policy will be enforced in email communications and the office hours. Keep in mind that all assignments are individual graded tasks. Any collaboration with other students is strictly prohibited and is considered as cheating. Students should NOT share any answer, solution, or code with other students. Violations of these policies would be penalized according to UMBC academic integrity policy.\n",

    "**You must run ALL cells** and get the correct outputs for all cells and give complete answers to all questions. **Cells/codes with no output get zero!**\n",

    "\n",
    "Wherever needed, you should replace `...` elipsis with your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "`...` may indicate one or more lines of missing codes. Some outputs are provided to you to use as reference and to verify that your output is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Preprocessing Effect on Grade**: Preprocessing steps are so critical in each part and you should pay special attention to make sure that you do all preprocessing steps correctly. That is why the reference outputs have been provided in preprocessing steps. Your notebook would become ineligible for grading implementation parts if you have wrong results/outputs of preprocessing, so be extremely careful with all preprocessing steps. "

    "\n",
    "ANSWER: Fine tuning the hyperparameters using `GridSearch` did not resolve the performance issues with this imbalanced set because the model just predicted 0 for the stroke value for every predictions. Despite giving it a high accuracy over .95 the precision and recall were both 0 showing that the best_rf was not efficient on this imbalanced dataset. The balanced accuracy decreased from .54 to .5 showing that it performs worse."

    "\n",
    "ANSWER: You would be able to determine which classifier has the better performance by observing which curve has the most area underneath of it. Hence, you could look at the curves in comparison to each other and see whidch curve is above the other thus implying that it has a higher AUC score."

    "- **Q6** [2 points]- Based on the ROC curves and auc scores, can you say that these classifiers have a good performance? In other words, is ROC curve a good indicator for classifier performance for this dataset? Justify your answer with clear arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER: Based on the AUC score and ROC curve you would conclude that both classifiers perform well with minor amounts of inaccuracies. Furthermore, the rf classifer has the AUC score of .83 while the xgb classifier has the AUC score of .80 and the closer it is to 1 shows that there is a better TPR to FPR ratio. However, the balanced accuracy is poor and so are the recall and precision scores thus the ROC curves and auc scores are not good indicators for classifier perofrmance for this dataset"
